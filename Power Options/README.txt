Installation

there is only one step you'll have to do.

1.Pin the shortcut to your taskbar(just drag the shortcut to the taskbar).

Now when you'll have to shutdown your computer justpoint your mouse towards the taskbar and click the shortcut.
Then you'll be prompted to a scree(with a cmd which i'll fix in later versions)with some options. click a option, say shutdown, and your pc/laptop wil shoutdown in just seconds.
